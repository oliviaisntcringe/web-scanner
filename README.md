# Web Vulnerability Scanner & Security Suite

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-yellow)

A comprehensive web security toolkit that combines advanced web crawling, machine learning-based vulnerability detection, and a Telegram bot interface for easy security testing and monitoring.

## üåü Project Overview

This project is a full-featured web security scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities in websites through multiple scanning techniques. It combines traditional pattern matching with machine learning models to provide accurate vulnerability detection across 14 types of security issues, following OWASP Top 10 categories.

### üìä Project Status

| Component | Completion | Stability | Note |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------|
| Web Crawler | 95% | High | Core functionality complete |
| ML Models | 80% | Medium | More training data needed |
| Vulnerability Detection | 85% | High | Regular pattern updates |
| Telegram Bot | 90% | High | All commands operational |
| Reporting | 75% | Medium | More formats needed |
| Exploitation | 70% | Medium | Limited to common vulnerabilities |

## üöÄ Features

### Core Components
- **Advanced Web Crawler**: Thoroughly scans websites to discover pages, forms, and resources
- **ML-Powered Vulnerability Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify 14 types of security vulnerabilities
- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Control scanning operations via convenient Telegram commands
- **Service Scanner**: Detects running services and their versions for vulnerability mapping
- **Exploitation Module**: Tests discovered vulnerabilities to verify exploitability
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports in multiple formats

### Vulnerability Detection
- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage**:
  - A01: Broken Access Control
  - A02: Cryptographic Failures
  - A03: Injection (SQL, XSS, Command)
  - A04: Insecure Design
  - A05: Security Misconfiguration
  - A06: Vulnerable Components
  - A07: Authentication Failures
  - A08: Software Data Integrity Failures
  - A09: Logging and Monitoring Failures
  - A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Additional Vulnerabilities**:
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Directory Traversal

### Scanning Modes
- **Single URL Analysis**: Quick scan of a specific page
- **Full Crawl & Scan**: Comprehensive website security audit
- **Exploitation Check**: Verify if vulnerabilities can be exploited
- **Service Scanning**: Check for vulnerable services and versions
- **Bruteforce Testing**: Test for weak credentials

## üìã Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scanner.git
cd web-scanner

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the scanner
python main.py
```

### Telegram Bot Configuration

To use the Telegram bot functionality, you need to configure your bot token and optionally set authorized chat IDs:

1. Edit the file `bot/bot.py` and replace the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` value with your actual token:
   ```python
   # Line 59 in bot/bot.py
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'
   ```

2. (Optional) To restrict bot access to specific users, uncomment and modify the `AUTHORIZED_USERS` list:
   ```python
   # Line 60-61 in bot/bot.py
   AUTHORIZED_USERS = [123456789, 987654321] # Replace with your chat IDs
   ```

You can get your chat ID by sending a message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram.

## üîß Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic scan
python main.py --target https://example.com

# Full crawl and scan with 5 threads, max 200 URLs, depth 3
python main.py --target https://example.com --crawl --max-urls 200 --depth 3 --threads 5

# Enable exploitation checks
python main.py --target https://example.com --exploit

# Ignore robots.txt restrictions
python main.py --target https://example.com --crawl --ignore-robots

# Save results to file
python main.py --target https://example.com --output results.json

# Run without Telegram bot
python main.py --target https://example.com --no-bot
```

### Telegram Bot Commands

```
/start - Get started with the bot
/scan [url] - Scan a single URL for vulnerabilities
/crawl [url] [max_urls] [max_depth] - Crawl and scan entire website
/exp [url] - Check for exploitable vulnerabilities
/info [url] - Get basic information about target
/brute [url] [service] - Run bruteforce on login services
/vuln [url] - Run vulnerability scan without crawling
```
